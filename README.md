This repo employs Chris Choy's 3d-R2N2 and BO Yang 3d-RecGAN as well as Jmaher19 construction in order to construct 3d representations of heads. THis is is a work in progress, the demo and requirements are the same as previous work in the project and is listed in the requirement files in the sub folders. 3D-R2N2 works in a theano environment and 3D-ReaGAN in tensor flow. To run the demo follow the read me for the 3D-R2N2 folder. Please stay tuned.

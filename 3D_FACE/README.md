## 3D_insight
This git repository is an exploration on the ability of neural networks to construct 3D models from 2D images. In this pursuit, the repository uses networks from Chris Choy (3D-R2N2) and Bo Yang (3D-RecGAN).

## Main Idea

Recent work improving 3D models using GANs in combination with previous work generating rough 3D models may enable the creation of useable 3D models from a group of 2D images.

## Proof of Concept

Below in an image of the input 2D images, initial rough reconstruction from the pretrained R2N2 network, and the overtrained RecGAN on the example bench.

## Package Requirements

The networks each have their own requirment files in their respective folders. It is recommended that a seperate virtual enviornment be set up for each one since R2N2 is written in theano and RecGAN is in Tensorflow.


## Runing a test

For now use notebooks to modify the input images (R2N2 Image_ingestion.ipynb) , edit the outputs from one network to another (R2N2 output to RecGan input.ipynb), and saving the final output as a .obj file, with modified scripts to run inference on the networks. Training data for the 3D-RecGAN model is being generated by running inference with R2N2 on images from shapenet data sets in order to generate lower quality 3D reconstructions. The training data will be used to explore the generalization potential of the 3D-RecGAN model. This work is ongoing, and includes creating a hybrid architecture with full TensorFlow implementation.
